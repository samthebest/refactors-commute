\section{Abstract and Introduction}

This paper first aims to provide absolute unambiguous clarity to ubiquitously used yet often ill-defined vocabulary within the field of Functional Programming.  For any commonly abused Category Theoretic language found in Functional Programming (e.g. Functor, Monad, Product, Coproduct, Kleisli, etc), we will first disambiguate using mathematical definitions, then using the example of the Category of Scala $S$ (which treats Types as $ob(S)$ and (1-param) functions as $hom(C)$) we formally derive corresponding laws that could (in principle) be written as Property Based tests in Scala.

A large point of the paper will be to show that use of Category Theoretic language can have practical application when these laws are known, because they facilitate refactoring and optimising code. When the laws are not known the vocabulary isn't all that useful to be blunt.

We intend on building up the notion of a Commutative Diagram and show that many refactorings or optimisations are the result of following a Commutative Diagram.

\section{Basic Definitions}

\subsection{Notation - Set Theory and Class Theory}

We will refer to \textbf{classes}, which can be thought of as like \textbf{sets} from Set Theory, except that classes may not necessary satisfy a classical axiomatization of Set Theory (e.g. Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel Set Theory).  The reason for this is that a class may consist of, say ``all sets", or ``all sets that are not members of themselves", which are not valid sets according to ZFC.

To keep notation straightforward we may still use Set Theoretic notation, for example $x \in S$, $A \subset B$ and write functions $f: A \rightarrow B$, but this should be read as $x$ is a member of the class $S$, etc.

\subsection{Definition - Category}

A category $C$ consists of the following three mathematical entities

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A class $ob(C)$, whose elements are called \textbf{objects}
    \item A class $hom(C)$, whose elements are called \textbf{morphisms}, or \textbf{maps}, or \textbf{arrows}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Every $f \in hom(C)$ has two (not necessarily distinct) corresponding members of $ob(C)$ called the \textbf{source object} and \textbf{target object}
        \item If $a, b \in ob(C)$ are the source and target objects respectively for some $f$, then we write $f: a \rightarrow b$, or say ``$f$ is a morphism from $a$ to $b$"
        \item For any $a, b \in ob(C)$ we write $hom(a, b)$ to be the class (or \textbf{hom-class}) of all morphisms from $a$ to $b$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item A binary operation $\circ: hom(b, c) \times hom(a, b) \rightarrow hom(a, c)$, called \textbf{Composition of Morphisms}, such that, for any $a, b, c, d \in ob(C)$, $f: a \rightarrow b$, $g: b \rightarrow c$, $h: c \rightarrow d$
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\circ: hom(b, c) \times hom(a, b) \rightarrow hom(a, c)$
        \item \textbf{Associativity}: $h \circ (g \circ f) = (h \circ g) \circ f$
        \item \textbf{Identity}: For every object $x \in ob(C)$ there exists $1_x: x \rightarrow x$ (sometimes written $Id_x$) called the \textbf{identity morphism for $x$} where $f \circ 1_a = f = 1_b \circ f$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item asdf
\end{enumerate}

When defining a Category it can often be important to explicitly define what is meant when morphisms are equal.

\subsection{Theorem - Identity is Unique}

For any category $C$ and any object $a \in ob(C)$, the identity morphism is unique

\subsubsection{Proof}

Let $I_1$ and $I_2$ satsify the definition of an identity morphism for $a$\newline
\\
\noindent $I_1 = I_2 \circ I_1 = I_1 \circ I_2 = I_2$ by definition
\\
\noindent Therefore $I_1 = I_2$ \blacksquare

\subsection{Example - Scala Category}

Let $S$ be the following

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $ob(S)$ is the class of Scala types
    \item $hom(S)$ is the class of Scala (1-param pure) functions (or methods)
    \item For any type \texttt{A} in $ob(S)$, this has a class of instances, which we will write $A$, and write \texttt{x:A} to mean $x \in A$ or ``x is of type \texttt{A}"
    \item We write $f: A \rightarrow B$ and \texttt{f:A => B} interchangeably without loss of generality
    \item $\circ$ will correspond to regular functional composition, i.e. $g \circ f$ is simply $\texttt{x => g(f(x))}
\end{enumerate}

We define equality on Scala functions as follows: for any types \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} Scala functions \texttt{f:A => B} and \texttt{g:A => B} are equal if and only if for any instance \texttt{x:A}, \texttt{f(x) = g(x)}.  We will henceforth certain typical refactoring operations preserve equality, like inlining and extracting functions.

\subsection{Theorem - The Scala Category is well defined}

$S$ is a well defined Category.

\subsubsection{Proof}

Given types \texttt{A, B, C, D} and functions \texttt{f:A => B}, \texttt{g:B => C}, \texttt{h:C => D}.\newline
\\
\noindent \textbf{Associativity:} we need to show $h \circ (g \circ f) = (h \circ g) \circ f$, which by definition of $=$ means showing:\newline
\noindent For any \texttt{x:A}, \newline
\texttt{(x => h((x => f(g(x)))(x)))(x)} = \texttt{(x => (x => h(g(x)))(f(x)))(x)}\newline
\\
\noindent \texttt{(x => h((x => f(g(x)))(x)))(x)} = \texttt{(x => h((f(g(x)))))(x)} by inlining lambda function \texttt{x => f(g(x))}\newline
= \texttt{(x => h(f(g(x))))(x)}  by removing redundant parens \newline
= \texttt{(x => (x => h(g(x)))(f(x)))(x)} by extracting out the lambda function \texttt{(x => h(g(x)))}\newline
\\
\noindent \textbf{Identity:} For any given type \texttt{A}, \texttt{id:A => A = (x: A) => x} is clearly the identitiy morphism.  Henceforth we will call this \texttt{id[A]}. \newline
\\
\noindent As required \blacksquare





\subsection{Definition - Isomorphisms (of morphisms)}

Let $C$ be a category, let $A, B \in ob(C)$, a morphism $f: A \rightarrow B$ is an isomorphism if and only if there exists $g: B \rightarrow A$ such that $g \circ f = 1_A$ and $f \circ g = 1_B$. When there exists an isomorphism $f: A \rightarrow B$ then we say $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic.

NOTE: There is also a definition of Ismorphism on Categories

\subsection{Example - Set Category}

Let $Set$ be the category where $ob(Set)$ is the class of sets and $hom(Set)$ is the class of functions on sets, then any bijection is an isomorphism.

\subsection{Definition - Universal Property}

Given some property of objects $\phi$ with one free variable, we say an object $A$ is \textbf{the unique object up to ismorphism satisfying $\phi(A)$} to mean that for any other $B$ such that $\phi(B)$, then there exists an isomorphism $f: A \rightarrow B$.

\subsection{Example - Equinumerosity}

The set $\{ 0, 1, 2, ..., n \}$ is the unique set up to ismorphism such that $|\{ 0, 1, 2, ..., n \}| = n$. This is interesting because it means we can define the number $n$ \textit{as the set} $\{ 0, 1, 2, ..., n \}$ if we let $=$ mean equality up to ismorphism.  There is a similar mechanism to produce infinite numbers also (called ordinal numbers).

\subsection{Definition - Endomorphism}

TODO


\subsection{Definition - Functor (Covariant)}

Let $C$ and $D$ be categories. A \textbf{Functor} from $C$ to $D$ is a mapping that

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Associates each object $x \in ob(C)$ to an object $F(x) \in ob(D)$
    \item Associates each morphism $f: x \rightarrow y$ in $hom(C)$ to a morphism $F(f): F(x) \rightarrow F(y)$ in $hom(D)$ such that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For every $x \in ob(C)$, $F(1_x) = 1_{F(x)}$
        \item For any morphisms $f: x \rightarrow y$ and $g: y \rightarrow z$ in $hom(C)$, $F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f)$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

I.e. Functors preserve identity and composition.

\subsection{Definition - Functor (Contravariant)}

TODO

\subsection{Example - Scala Parametric Types with \texttt{map}}
\label{Functor Example}

Let \texttt{F} be a type in Scala with one type parameter, and a method \texttt{map}, then define a Functor $F$ as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Associates each type $A \in ob(S)$ to \texttt{F[A]}
    \item Associates each function $f: A \rightarrow B$ in $hom(S)$ to a morphism $\texttt{map}_F(f): F[A] \rightarrow F[B]$ where for any \texttt{x:F[A]}, $\texttt{map}_F(f)(x) = \texttt{x.map(f)}$
\end{enumerate}

For most native types, like \texttt{List}, \texttt{Option}, etc the induced Functor is indeed a well defined Functor, i.e. satisfies identity and composition preservation.

\subsection{Example - \texttt{List} induces a well defined Functor}

Notation as before \newline
\\
\noindent \textbf{Identity Preservation:} For any \texttt{x:F[A]}, \newline
$\texttt{map}_F(1_A)(x) = \texttt{map}_F(\texttt{id[A]})(x)$ by definition of $1$ \newline
$= \texttt{x.map}(\texttt{id[A]})$ by \hyperref[Functor Example]{definition} \newline
$= \texttt{x}$ an obvious property of lists \newline
$= \texttt{id[F[A]]}(x)$ by definition of \texttt{id} \newline
$= 1_{\texttt{F[A]}}$ by definition of $1$ \newline
\\
\noindent \textbf{Composition:} For any \texttt{x:F[A]}, \newline
$\texttt{map}_F(g \circ f)(x) = \texttt{map}_F(\texttt{x => g(f(x))})(x)$ by definition of $\circ$ \newline
$= \texttt{x.map(x => g(f(x)))}$ by \hyperref[Functor Example]{definition} \newline
$= \texttt{x.map(f).map(g)}$ an obvious property of lists \newline
$= \texttt{map}_F(g)(\texttt{x.map(f)})$ by \hyperref[Functor Example]{definition} \newline
$= \texttt{map}_F(g)(\texttt{map}_F(f)(x))$ by \hyperref[Functor Example]{definition} \newline
$= \texttt{map}_F(g) \circ \texttt{map}_F(f)(x)$ by definition of $\circ$ \newline
Therefore $\texttt{map}_F(g \circ f) = \texttt{map}_F(g) \circ \texttt{map}_F(f)$ \newline
\\
\noindent As required \blacksquare

\subsection{Definition - Functor Laws}

We say a 1-parameterised type \texttt{F} satisfies the Functor Laws provided for any \texttt{x:F[A]}:
\\
\noindent \texttt{x.map(id[A])} \texttt{must\_===} \texttt{x} \newline
\texttt{x.map(f).map(g)} \texttt{must\_===} \texttt{x.map(g compose f)} \newline

\subsection{Remark - Practical Application}

\textbf{Optimisations:} Lazily evaluated types, like \texttt{Iterators}, Streams, RDDs, Scalding datasets, etc can avoid multiple traversals of underlying data (which may well require reads from network or disk) when multiple \texttt{map} calls are chained together (in not necessarily clear ways due to function boundaries).

\textbf{Refactors:} Sometimes \texttt{x.map(f).map(g)} is easier to read sometimes \texttt{x.map(g compose f)} may be easier to read depending on the context.

\subsection{Definition - Product}

TODO

\subsection{Example - Tuples in Scala}

Given two types \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}, we can consider the Tuple type \texttt{(A, B)} with functions \texttt{\_.\_1} and \texttt{\_.\_2}.

\subsection{Proof - Tuples are Products}

Given some type \texttt{V} with $q_1: V \rightarrow A$ and $q_2: V \rightarrow B$, then if we let $q(v) := (q_1(v), q_2(v))$ then the proof follows easily using the definitions.

\subsection{Definition - Product Laws}

TODO

\subsection{Definition - Coproduct}

Let $C$ be a category, let $x_1, x_2 \in ob(C)$, the \textbf{coproduct} of $x_1$ and $x_2$, written $x_1 \oplus x_2$ or $x_1 \sqcup x_2$ (or even sometimes $x_1 + x_2$), is the unique object (up to isomorphism) such that there exists morphisms $i_1: x_1 \rightarrow x_1 \sqcup x_2$ and $i_2: x_2 \rightarrow x_1 \sqcup x_2$ such that for any object $y$ and morphisms $f_1: x_1 \rightarrow y$, $f_2: x_2 \rightarrow y$, there exists a unique morphism $f: x_1 \sqcup x_2 \rightarrow y$ such that $f_1 = f \circ i_1$ and $f_2 = f \circ i_2$.

\subsection{Example - Disjoint Union}

(In the $Set$ category) let's define $\oplus$ to be disjoint union for sets, i.e. given sets $X_1$ and $X_2$, then 

$$X_1 \oplus X_2 := \{ (x, 1) | x \in X_1 \} \cup \{ (x, 2) | x \in X_2 \} $$

\noindent Then let $i_1: x \mapsto (x, 1)$ and $i_2: x \mapsto (x, 2)$. 
Now given any set $Y$ and morphisms $f_1: X_1 \rightarrow y$, $f_2: X_2 \rightarrow Y$, then define $f$ such that $f: (x, 1) \mapsto f_1(x)$ and $f: (x, 2) \mapsto f_2(x)$, note that the crux of this proof is the observation that $f$ is well defined; i.e. given a member of $X_1 \oplus X_2$ it's easy to construct a function that tells us if the member was formed from $i_1$ or $i_2$ by looking at the second element (the index) of the tuple.\newline
\\
\noindent So $f(i_1(x)) = f((x, 1)) = f_1(x)$ and $f(i_2(x)) = f((x, 2)) = f_2(x)$ \blacksquare

\subsection{Example - Either}

$i_1$ and $i_2$ are \texttt{Left(\_)} and \texttt{Right(\_)} resp.  Define $f$ such that $f: \texttt{Left(x)} \mapsto f_1(x)$ and $f: \texttt{Right(x)} \mapsto f_2(x)$.  Again the crux of this proof is that $f$ is well defined, here we know that we can pattern match on Eithers to determine if they are Lefts or Rights, and we know we can get out of them what we put into them bijectively. \newline
\\
\noindent Suppose \texttt{Left(x)} was not well behaved, say \texttt{Left(x).get} returned some \texttt{y!=x}, then $f(i_1(x)) = f_1(y)$ and $f_1(y)$ may not be equal to $f_1(x)$.

\subsection{Remark - Deriving Useful Coproduct Laws}

In the above we observe the importance of having a well defined way to detecting which of $i_1$ or $i_2$ was used to construct the coproduct element. Furthermore this is more practically instructive than the full definition, which is somewhat too abstract to really use in day to day programming.  Therefore the below laws give us a less abstract but more intuitive laws.  When these laws hold, then we can construct the required $f$ to prove that the type is a Coproduct.\newline
\\
Note that these laws may be \textit{stronger} than necessary, i.e. there may exist a type which is technically a coproduct but doesn't satisfy the below laws (\textbf{Exercise:} prove either way).

\subsection{Definition - Coproduct Laws}

A (2-parameter) type \texttt{CP[A,B]} is a coproduct provided it has constructors \texttt{left(a:A):CP[A,B]} and \texttt{right(a:A):CP[A,B]}, and extractors \texttt{getLeft:Option[A]} and \texttt{getRight:Option[B]}, such that given \texttt{x:CP[A,B]}, \texttt{a:A}, \texttt{b:B}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{x.getLeft.isDefined} ex-or \texttt{x.getRight.isDefined}
    \item \texttt{left(a).getLeft.isDefined} and \texttt{right(b).getRight.isDefined}
    \item \texttt{left(a).getLeft.get} \texttt{must\_=== a}  and \texttt{right(b).getRight.get} \texttt{must\_=== b}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Remark - N-ary Products and Coproducts}

It should be fairly implicit how to extend the definitions to $n$ objects rather than just $2$ using an index set $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$
